# HamCalc64
HamCalc utilities by George Murphy, VE3ERP ported to Quick Basic, 64 bit.  (QB64)

The original code was developed for MS-DOS in GWBASIC.  That version is still 
available for download at http://www.cq-amateur-radio.com/cq_ham_calc/cq_ham_calc.html

I pulled it down and have *mostly* converted it to compile on 64 bit Windows using
QB64. www.qb64.net  You're welcome to the modified sources here.  But know that more
work is needed before they are fully useable.

Right now, the menu system sort of works, but only if you have the menus in 
\\HamCalc64\Menu and the program files in \\HamCalc64\Prog.  That's at the top
of my list to fix next.

There are so many files, that once I compile them, they compile on both Windows and
Linux, they are too big to store on github.  If I can find a nice place to hang them
on the internet, I will.
